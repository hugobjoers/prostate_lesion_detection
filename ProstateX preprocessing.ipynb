    "  - Go to the \"Detailed Description\" tab \n",
    "  - In Section \"PROSTATEx Challenge (November 21, 2016 to February 16, 2017)\" download all the data, except for the .bmp files\n",
    "  - In Section \"PROSTATEx-2 â€” SPIE-AAPM-NCI Prostate MR Gleason Grade Group Challenge (May 15, 2017 to August 3, 2017)\" download only lesion information (.zip), as the images are exactly the same as the ones we have already downloaded.\n",
    "  - Once all images have been downloaded, please modify the path below to point to them\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- We will need ``plot_lib`` to visualize the images as they are processed:\n",
    " - `plot_lib`: https://github.com/OscarPellicer/plot_lib\n",

    "- Edit the following cell according to where the downloaded data is located.\n",
